SidebarHoverToggle
==========================

Opens the sidebar when hovering over your gutter, and closes it when hovering anywhere else

This plugin only works in Sublime text 3 (Build 3124 >), since it uses the native `on_hover` command.


Installation
=====

Note that this plugin has an open pull request to be added to the Package control database. For now please follow the following manual installation instructions (using package control).

1. Open up sublime, and open the command pallette (<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd>).
2. In the dialog, type in "add repo" (without quotes), and select the option "Package Control: Add Repository".
3. Next, a new dialog will show up, asking you for the repo URL. Use the following URL `https://github.com/Skullsneeze/SidebarHoverToggle.git`, and press enter
4. Once added, open up the command pallette again, and type in "install", and select the option "Package Control: Install Package".

6. Restart Sublime (quit the app on Mac OS (<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>)).


Todo
=====

* Find a way to change the interval of checking mouse hover, so that the command responds quicker.
